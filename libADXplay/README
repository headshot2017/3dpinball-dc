LibADX is a library for decoding ADX audio files using the
Kallisti:OS development environment, intended for use only
on the Sega Dreamcast game console.

LibADX features full implementation of the ADX looping function.
The functions available include play, pause, stop, restart.

This library is completely free to modify and or redistribute.

LibADX is a static library, build the library with the makefile:
LibADX/LibADX/Makefile

Then build the example player:
LibADX/Makefile

The example player uses a hard-coded file name, so make sure
to include a "sample.adx" on the root of the /cd/, or modify
the source libADXplay.c to load a different file.
